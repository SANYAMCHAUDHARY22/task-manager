### 3. **Error Handling**

Implement error handling for both front-end and back-end components. For example, in your API calls in the frontend, you should catch errors and handle them appropriately.

### 4. **Responsive Design**

Ensure your application is responsive by using CSS media queries or a CSS framework like Bootstrap.

By following these steps and ensuring your project structure and code align with these guidelines, you can verify that your Task Management Application is built correctly and meets the assignment requirements.
